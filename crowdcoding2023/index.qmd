> "We demonstrate the effectiveness of using Amazon Mechanical Turk for a variety of natural language annotation tasks. Our evaluation of non-expert labeler data vs. expert annotations for five tasks found that for many tasks only a small number of nonexpert annotations per item are necessary to equal the performance of an expert annotator."

* When money is involved, there will be deception
* Think about alternative ([Guo et al.](https://doi.org/10.1177/1077699019891437))
* I am brave enough to admit I was stupid. 
* According to the literature, academic types (except me) never fail ([Lind et al.](https://doi.org/10.1080/19312458.2017.1317338); [Benoit et al.](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055416000058); [Haselmayer & Jenny](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-016-0412-4)).
